The PDF has an image for two aquifer tests in the Hadley Valley, a sand aquifer in Will County that is an important water source for the city of Joliet. 

Unlike tests that we did in class, there is vertical leakage involved in this calculation. Modify your code so that you calculate this leakage following the methodology laid out by Prickett.

You only need to repeat one of these tests. You will need to approximate the data from the curve since the original data is not available.
