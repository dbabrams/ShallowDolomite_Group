The PDF has an image (Figure 10) of two aquifer tests in the Hadley Valley, a sand aquifer in Will County that is an important water source for the city of Joliet. 

Use either the Theis curve matching or Jacob Straight Line method that we did in class to calculate storage and transmissivity for both tests. Make sure to comment on how your values compare to the analysis by Prickett. Why are they different? Which gives you a better estimate of sand hydraulic conductivity for your model? What else did you learn from Prickett's analysis that Theis/Jacob did not tell you?

You will need to approximate the data from the curve since the original data is not available. This will admittedly be approximate, since the resolution of this image is rather poor. Welcome to applied modeling!!!!!
